                <p>Particularly when these reverse power flows occur, as shown in the animation, this can induce spikes in voltage, which are kept between specific bounds to avoid damaging customer appliances and equipment. If the voltage deviates from the acceptable range, solar systems are programmed to power off completely (or 'trip’), leading to a total loss of the customer’s solar generation. To prevent such ‘unplanned’ issues and to ensure fair access to grid exports, networks are beginning to send signals to temporarily reduce the power output from rooftop solar. This means that customers’ exports (which typically attract a feed-in tariff of around 6c/kWh) are reduced, rather than switching off the whole system, which also loses the solar that households are self-consuming (typically worth the full retail value of around 30c/kWh). Both situations are referred to as ‘curtailment’ of solar PV. This curtailment due to network limitations is considered ‘technical’ curtailment. But ‘economic’ curtailment can also occur, when the energy market has an oversupply of power and prices become negative, incentivising generators to switch off. This is common for larger scale solar and wind farms (see sister UNSW tool) but will increasingly become an option for rooftop solar.</p>

            <h2>The curtailment trend:</h2>
            <p>Curtailment is currently limited, at less than 1% of average solar generation. However, network businesses are forecasting curtailment to increase substantially out to 2040 if no action is taken. </p>

            <h2> Forecast consumer differences: Endeavour Energy</h2>
            <p>If left unmanaged, some customers will be more affected than others. Generally, the further a solar-equipped home is from the local substation, the more it will experience voltage issues and associated curtailment. As such, fairness becomes a crucial factor in how networks manage curtailment, underlining the need to account for variation among customers.  
Should every customer have the same level of access to connect and export solar to the grid?</p>
