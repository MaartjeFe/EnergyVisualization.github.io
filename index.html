            <h2>The curtailment trend:</h2>
            <p>Curtailment is currently limited, at less than 1% of average solar generation. However, network businesses are forecasting curtailment to increase substantially out to 2040 if no action is taken. </p>

            <h2> Forecast consumer differences: Endeavour Energy</h2>
            <p>If left unmanaged, some customers will be more affected than others. Generally, the further a solar-equipped home is from the local substation, the more it will experience voltage issues and associated curtailment. As such, fairness becomes a crucial factor in how networks manage curtailment, underlining the need to account for variation among customers.  
Should every customer have the same level of access to connect and export solar to the grid?</p>
            <iframe src="2024Consumer.html" width="85%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>



        <h2> Adressing curtailment</h2>
        
        <p>A range of investments can be made to manage the issue, and enable continued uptake of rooftop solar uptake by residents and businesses. However, this must be carefully considered, as the cost of such measures is spread across all energy customers, including those without solar.
Explore the impact of adding each new strategy for network businesses to manage curtailment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>+ Tariff Reform: Shifting towards network charges and rewards that vary by time of day    and season for customers who generate their own energy (‘prosumers’), better reflecting the underlying infrastructure costs.</li>
  <li>+ Phase Balancing: Utilising low voltage (LV) data to balance the power supply across different network circuits (phases), which enhances the grid’s capacity to host more customers and DER.</li>
  <li>+ Distribution Transformer Tap Optimisation: Changing transformer tap settings to adjust the changes in voltage, allowing higher solar uptake.</li>
    <li>+ Dynamic Voltage Management System (DVMS): Improving visibility and analytics of the LV network to better control voltage levels, thereby improving the network's capacity, safety, reliability, and efficiency.</li>
    <li>+ Hot Water Solar Soaking (part of controlled loads): Using smart meters to control hot water systems to recharge during sunshine hours, to absorb excess solar energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional strategies that are not visualized in the graph:</p>
<ul>
   <li>+ Dynamic Operating Envelopes / Flexible Exports: Remotely sending signals to solar power systems to temporarily reduce grid exports, in response to ‘technical’ network constraints, or ‘economic’ market pricing signals. This lets customers install larger energy systems and export more energy than usual when the network is not constrained.</li> 
</ul>
